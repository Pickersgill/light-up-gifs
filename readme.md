# A GIF generator for Light-Up
This simple tool helps to test and visualize plans generated by the fast-downward solver for the light-up
puzzle.

This is a very bespoke tool, as such there are lots of expectations about the format of the files.

## Expected File Formats

### The Problem File
The predicate naming convention is expected to follow the one proposed in the Final Project help document.
Specifically

- position of black squares represented by a 'black xpos ypos' predicate
- surrounded counts for black squares represented by a 'surrounded xpos ypos num' predicate
- x position type represented as 'xpos' and instances following 'X1, X2, X3 etc.'
- y position type represented as 'ypos' and instances following 'Y1, Y2, Y3 etc.'
- number type represented as 'num' and instances following 'N1, N2, N3 etc.'

### The Plan File
I actually don't know much about this file since I'm not generating it. The important thing is that
the name of the action in your domain file must be 'light-up' with an xpos and ypos argument.

## Usage
Designed for use with Python 3.8.
For usage help use ```python3.8 gifi.py -h```
